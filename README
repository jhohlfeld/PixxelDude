This experiment is about creating an isometric game, written in javascript and targeting the html5 canvas as rendering stage.

Though the story of the game remains unknown to both the public and the creator and the pace of progress is slow, plans are to create a level editor and animation tools all written in javascript.

This project uses http://gamejs.org/ as underlying rendering engine.
